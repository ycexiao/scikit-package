================================
Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
================================

Here, you will learn how to customize the ``scikit-package`` template for your own project, such as setting the line-width and including/excluding files for PyPI distribution. We also provide design decisions for the current setup of the ``scikit-package`` template.

Pre-commit
----------

``Pre-commit`` attempts to automatically fix code style issues. The following questions are used to customize the ``pre-commit`` configuration for your project's needs.

How is pre-commit used in each Level?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here is a recommended setup and hooks for ``pre-commit`` for each level:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Level
    - Name
    - Recommended setup
    - Hooks used
  * - 3
    - ``workspace``
    - Run ``pre-commit run --all-files`` locally.
    - Automatic linting with ``black``, ``prettier``, ``docformatter``
  * - 4
    - ``system``
    - Use ``pre-commit install`` locally, ``pre-commit CI`` in GitHub
    - Level 3 hooks, PEP 8 check with ``flake8``, default hooks (merge conflicts, end-of-file-fixer, etc.)
  * - 5
    - ``public``
    - Same as Level 4
    - Level 4 hooks, no commits to ``main``, spell checker with ``codespell``,


How do I modify line-width limits?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Three files need to be modified:

1. In ``.isort.cfg``, modify ``line_length``.
2. In ``.flake8``, modify ``max-line-length``.
3. In ``pyproject.toml``, modify ``line-length`` under ``[tool.black]``.


How do I skip a specific file for ``flake8`` and ``black``?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To skip files checked by ``flake8``, include the file path in ``.flake8`` under the ``exclude`` section.

To prevent ``black`` from formatting, include the file path in ``pyproject.toml`` under the ``[tool.black]`` section.

.. _faq-pre-commit-error:

How do I fix conflicted hook auto-fix errors?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may encounter the following error message when you run ``git commit -m <your-commit-message>``: ::

  Stashed changes conflicted with hook auto-fixes...

To solve this problem, run ``git add <file>`` on the files modified by ``pre-commit``. Then, re-enter same commit message above using ``git commit -m <your-commit-message>``. Why do we need to run ``git add`` again? The files that are linted by ``pre-commit`` are not staged to the local Git database. So, we stage them manually again with ``git add``.

.. _faq-codespell-ignore:

How do I ignore words/lines/files in automatic spelling checks in pre-commit?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. include:: snippets/codespell-ignore.rst

Project setup
-------------

.. _faq-project-setup-namespace:

I read ``scikit-package`` allows namespace support for importing packages. What is it, and how do I set it up?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A research group often maintains multiple software packages under a single GitHub organization.
For the purposes of branding and also differentiating packages with similar names, it can sometimes be beneficial for the organization or research group name (or some other branding name) to appear in the package name itself.

Here is an example. Consider the package called ``diffpy.pdffit2``. The package starts with an organization identifier of ``diffpy``, and the package name is ``pdffit2``. There is a separate GitHub repository for this package (https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.pdffit2) while it is developed under the DiffPy organization (https://github.com/diffpy). The user can import the package as ``import diffpy.pdffit2 as pdffit2`` in any Python script.

.. note::

  This namespace feature is only available in Level 5, ``public``. In programming, a "namespace" refers to a unique identifier that can hold many classes, functions, and variable names. Here we extend the concept that the top level namespace holds multiple packages.

What is the difference in folder structure compared to a standard package?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For a standard package, the folder structure is as follows:

.. code-block:: text

  ├── src
  │   ├── <package_name>
  │   │   ├── __init__.py
  │   │   ├── file_one.py
  │   │   ├── file_two.py

For a package to be imported using ``import <namespace_name>.<package_name>``, the folder structure is as follows:

.. code-block:: text

  ├── src
  │   ├── <namespace_name>
  │   │   ├── __init__.py
  │   │   └── <package_name>
  │   │       ├── __init__.py
  │   │       ├── file_one.py
  │   │       ├── file_two.py

How do I set it up with ``scikit-package``?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Our ``scikit-package`` automatically handles this folder setup for you! When you run ``package create public``, simply enter ``project_name`` as, e.g., ``<namespace_name>.<package_name>``, like the default value provided. ``scikit-package`` adjusts the folder structure based on the presence of the ``.`` that separates the ``<namespace_name>`` and ``<package_name>``.

In Level 5, why do we adopt ``README.rst`` instead of ``README.md``?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We adopt ``README.rst`` at Level 5 because reStructuredText (``.rst``) provides a more configurable format and control. One key advantage of ``.rst`` is its native support for advanced formatting, such as precise control over image size and layout: ::

  .. |Icon| image:: img/logos/scikit-package-logo-text.png
      :target: https://Billingegroup.github.io/scikit-package
      :height: 150px

Achieving the same result in Markdown often requires raw HTML, which is less readable and may render inconsistently across platforms.

Switching to ``README.rst`` at Level 5 helps users appreciate the formatting power of ``.rst`` and serves as a stepping stone toward writing full documentation in ``.rst`` as part of the ``scikit-package`` documentation standard.

Release
-------

.. _release_authority:

How can I change who is authorized to release a package?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In ``.github/workflows/build-wheel-release-upload.yml``, modify ``github_admin_username`` to the desired GitHub username. This username will be able to authorize the release by pushing the tag as instructed :ref:`here <release-instructions-project-owner>`.

How is the package version set and retrieved?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In ``pyproject.toml``, the ``setuptools-git-versioning`` tool is used to dynamically retrieve the version based on the latest tag in the repository. The latest tag is pushed during the release workflow. The dynamically parsed version is globally accessible, via ``<package-name>.__version__``.

How do I include/exclude files in PyPI release?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``MANIFEST.in`` file is used to control which files are included in the source distribution. Try running ``python -m build`` and see the content under the ``dist`` folder generated.

To include all files under a folder, use ``graft``:

.. code-block:: text

   graft src
   graft tests

To include specific file(s), use ``include``:

.. code-block:: text

   include AUTHORS.txt LICENSE*.txt README.rst

To exclude files globally, use ``globally-exclude``:

.. code-block:: text

   global-exclude *.py[cod]  # Exclude all .pyc, .pyo, and .pyd files.
   global-exclude .DS_Store  # Exclude Mac filesystem artifacts.
   global-exclude __pycache__  # Exclude Python cache directories.
   global-exclude .git*  # Exclude git files and directories.

Why have we decided to include test files in the PyPI source distribution?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We decided to include test files in the PyPI source distribution to facilitate unit testing with a newly built Conda package.

The conda-forge CI uses the source code distributed via PyPI to build a Conda package. After building the package, we want to run pytest to ensure all unit tests pass before release. Therefore, test files must be included in the source code. In contrast, no documentation is distributed with the package, as it is already accessible from the GitHub repository and does not serve a practical purpose in the distribution package itself.


Documentation
-------------

How can I preview ``Sphinx`` documentation in real-time?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. include:: snippets/doc-local-build.rst

.. _faq-doc-api-standard:

How do I build API .rst files automatically for a standard Python package?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can generate ``.rst`` files using the ``sphinx-apidoc`` extension.

#. Install ``sphinx-apidoc``:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install sphinx-apidoc

#. Run the following command to generate ``.rst`` under the ``doc/source/api`` directory:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sphinx-apidoc -o doc/source/api src/<package_dir_name>

#. Done!

Instead of manually running the ``sphinx-apidoc -o ..`` command from your terminal, here is a recommended way to **automate** the process of generating API documentation:

#. Replace the following code block in your ``doc/source/conf.py`` from

    .. code-block:: python

        extensions = [
            "sphinx.ext.autodoc",
            "sphinx.ext.napoleon",
            "sphinx.ext.todo",
            "sphinx.ext.viewcode",
            "sphinx.ext.intersphinx",
            "sphinx_rtd_theme",
            "m2r",
        ]

    to

    .. code-block:: python

        extensions = [
            "sphinxcontrib.apidoc",  # Add this extension to run sphinx-apidoc
            "sphinx.ext.napoleon",
            "sphinx.ext.todo",
            "sphinx.ext.viewcode",
            "sphinx.ext.intersphinx",
            "sphinx_rtd_theme",
            "m2r",
        ]


        # Configure where to find the source code and write API .rst files
        apidoc_module_dir = '../../src/<package_dir_name>'
        apidoc_output_dir = 'api'
        apidoc_excluded_paths = ['tests']
        apidoc_separate_modules = True

#. Replace ``<package_dir_name>`` with the directory name under ``src``, e.g., ``my_package``.

#. Run ``sphinx-reload doc``.

#. Notice that the ``.rst`` files under ``doc/source/api`` are generated whenever the documentation is re-rendered.

#. Done! You can ``git add doc/source/api`` and commit the changes.

.. _faq-doc-api-namespace:

How do I build API .rst files for a Python package with a namespace import?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using a namespace import, ``sphinx-apidoc`` will not work. We have develoepd our own script called ``auto_api.py`` to generate the API documentation.

#. Run ``git clone https://github.com/Billingegroup/release-scripts.git`` into a folder outside of the project directory. Here is the folder structure:

    .. code-block:: text

      dev/
      ├── <namespace_name>.<package_name>
      │   ├── pyproject.toml
      │   └── doc/source/api/
      │   └── src
      │       └── <namespace_name>
      │           ├── __init__.py
      │           └── <pakcage_name>
      │               ├── __init__.py
      │               └── file_one.py
      └── release-scripts
          └── auto_api.py

#. Run ``cd <namespace_name>.<package_name>`` to enter the package directory.

#. Run ``python -m build`` to build the package. You may have to install ``python-build`` first.

#. Run the ``auto_api.py`` script. This is done by running ``python <path_to_auto_api_script> <package_name> <path_to_package_name> <path_to_api_directory>``. Here is an example below:

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd ~/dev/<namespace_name>.<package_name>
        python ../release-scripts/auto_api.py <namespace_name>.<package_name> ./src/<namespace_name>/<package_name> ./doc/source/api

    .. note:: Here is an example of how ``diffpy.utils`` uses the ``auto_api.py`` script. The folder structure is as follows:

      .. code-block:: text

          dev/
          ├── diffpy.utils
          │   ├── pyproject.toml
          │   └── doc/source/api/
          │   └── src
          │       └── diffpy
          │           ├── __init__.py
          │           └── utils
          │               ├── __init__.py
          │               └── file_one.py
          └── release-scripts
              └── auto_api.py

      Then you would run the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

            cd ~/dev/diffpy.utils
            python ../release-scripts/auto_api.py diffpy.utils ./src/diffpy/utils ./doc/source/api/

#. Done! You will see that the ``.rst`` files under ``doc/source/api`` are generated.


#. (Optional) Feel free to use the following shortcut. Add the following function to your ``~/.bashrc`` or ``~/.zshrc`` file and activate it by running ``source ~/.bashrc`` or ``source ~/.zshrc``:

    .. code-block:: bash

        api() {
            IMPORT_NAME=$(basename "$(pwd)")  # e.g., "diffpy.utils"
            IMPORT_PATH=$(echo "$IMPORT_NAME" | tr '.' '/')  # e.g., "diffpy/utils"
            MODULE_PATH="src/$IMPORT_PATH"  # e.g., "src/diffpy/utils"
            DOC_PATH="doc/source/api"

            python "../release-scripts/auto_api.py" "$IMPORT_NAME" "$MODULE_PATH" "$DOC_PATH"
        }

    Once you enter the project directory, run ``api`` in the terminal to generate the API documentation automatically so that you don't have to type the full command every time!

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please read our pre-release section in the conda-forge release guide :ref:`here <conda-forge-pre-release>`.

GitHub Actions
--------------

.. _github-actions-python-versions:

In Level 5, How do I set different Python versions for GitHub CI?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python |PYTHON_MAX_VERSION| is the current default Python version in ``.github/workflows/tests-on-pr.yml`` and ``.github/workflows/publish-docs-on-release.yml``. Python |PYTHON_MIN_VERSION| to |PYTHON_MAX_VERSION| are used in ``.github/workflows/matrix-and-codecov-on-merge-to-main.yml``. To override the defaults, modify the three ``.yml`` files mentioned above in ``.github/workflows/`` as shown below:

1. Add ``python_version`` in ``.github/workflows/tests-on-pr.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   jobs:
    tests-on-pr:
      uses: Billingegroup/release-scripts/.github/workflows/_tests-on-pr.yml@v0
    with:
      project: package-name
      c_extension: false
      headless: false
      python_version: 3.12
    secrets:
      CODECOV_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}

2. Add ``python_version`` in ``.github/workflows/_publish-docs-on-release.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   jobs:
    docs:
      uses: Billingegroup/release-scripts/.github/workflows/_tests-on-pr.yml@v0
    with:
      project: package-name
      c_extension: false
      headless: false
      python_version: 3.12

3. Add ``python_versions`` in ``.github/workflows/_matrix-and-codecov-on-merge-to-main.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   jobs:
    matrix-coverage:
      uses: Billingegroup/release-scripts/.github/workflows/_matrix-and-codecov-on-merge-to-main.yml@v0
    with:
      ...
      python_versions: "3.11, 3.12"

In Level 5, what are the workflows running in each pull request?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. The first workflow is called ``Tests on PR`` from ``.github/workflows/tests-on-pr.yml``. This workflow creates a new conda environment on Linux and installs the dependencies listed in the ``requirements`` folder using the ``conda-forge`` channel. The conda environment is configured to use the highest Python version specified when the project was initially created. It then runs the unit tests located in the ``tests`` folder, similar to how you would run them locally.

#. The second workflow uses ``pre-commit CI``. This workflow checks the incoming code in the PR using ``pre-commit`` hooks and automatically applies fixes when possible. If any fixes are made, an additional commit is created by the ``pre-commit`` app. However, some hooks, such as spell checkers, may still fail even after auto-fixes. In such cases, the CI fails. The user first needs to pull the additional commit made by the ``pre-commit CI``, fix the error manually, and then push a commit to the working branch.

#. The third workflow uses the ``Codecov`` app, which adds a comment to the PR summarizing the changes in code coverage as part of the ``.github/workflows/tests-on-pr.yml`` workflow. This workflow fails if no tests are provided for the new code or if the test coverage percentage decreases below the acceptable threshold. The threshold can be adjusted in the ``.codecov.yml`` file located in the project root directory.

#. The fourth workflow checks for a news file in the PR using ``.github/workflows/check-news-item.yml``. If no news item is included for the proposed changes, this workflow fails and leaves a comment prompting the contributor to submit a new PR with the appropriate news file. Please refer to the best practices section on news items :ref:`here <news-item-practice>`.

In Level 5, I see that another workflow is running once a PR is merged to ``main``. What is it?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The workflow ``.github/workflows/matrix-and-codecov-on-merge-to-main.yml`` is triggered. The goal is to ensure the latest code is tested not only on Linux but also across multiple operating systems and Python versions. This workflow runs tests on macOS (both Apple Silicon and Intel chips), Linux, and Windows and against three different Python versions, including the latest configured version. To modify the Python versions used in the workflows, refer to :ref:`github-actions-python-versions`.

.. note:: These workflow files call scripts located at https://github.com/Billingegroup/release-scripts, which are centrally managed by the ``scikit-package`` development team. This centralized approach ensures that individual packages do not need to be updated separately when adding support for new Python versions or operating systems.


What is the difference between ``pull_request`` and ``pull_request_target``?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the current GitHub CI for checking a news item, ``pull_request_target`` is used instead of ``pull_request`` as shown below:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: Check News Item

   on:
    pull_request_target:
      branches:
       - main

- ``pull_request``: This event configures the ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` with read-only permissions by default, especially when triggered by forks.
- ``pull_request_target``: This event grants the ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` write permissions, enabling it to perform actions that modify the repository, such as posting comments, updating pull request statuses, or merging code. The news CI creates a comment when an additional news ``.rst`` is not found under the ``news`` folder. Hence, ``pull_request_target`` is used.

Another key difference is that with ``pull_request_target``, the ``.yml`` file **must already be merged** in the base branch at the time the pull request is opened or updated. For more, please refer to `GitHub docs <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target>`_.

.. _faq-dependency-management:

Dependency management
---------------------

.. _faq-dependency-files:

What are ``docs.txt``, ``test.txt``, ``build.txt``, and ``conda.txt`` files under ``\requirements`` in Level 4 and Level 5?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:pip.txt: list all PyPI packages required to install the package via `pip install <package-name>`.

:conda.txt: list all Conda packages required for running the package in GitHub CI. It should be typically identcal as the ``pip.txt`` file.

:test.txt: packages required for the testing suite to ensure all tests pass.

:docs.txt: packages required for building the package documentation page.

:build.txt: list all conda packages required for building the package in GitHub CI, including those specified in the build section of meta.yaml (conda-recipe).


.. _faq-pip-conda-both-provided:


Why are both ``pip.txt`` and ``conda.txt`` provided?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our preferred choice for installing the scikit-packaged package is as a Conda package, as outlined in the template ``README.rst`` file. With Conda, the end user can install all associated dependencies by running ``conda create --name new_env <package-name>``. Additionally, the environment is tested via conda-forge CI before the Conda package is released, which helps ensure the package's compatibility with its dependencies. Hence, we list conda package dependencies in ``conda.txt``.

However, we also want to allow users to install the package via ``pip``. To support this, we provide a separate file for pip dependencies, ``pip.txt``. In most cases, the dependencies listed in ``conda.txt`` and ``pip.txt`` will be identical. However, there can be exceptions. For example, ``matplotlib-base`` is preferred for Conda installations, while ``matplotlib`` is used for pip installations.

.. _faq-github-workflow:

GitHub workflow
---------------

I am new to GitHub. Why do we use Git/GitHub?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GitHub allows multiple contributors to work on a software project simultaneously under an organization like ``Billingegroup`` or ``diffpy``. There are two primary needs. First, we want to ensure that any changes under this organization are reviewed by the organization's project owner. Second, we want to ensure we add new changes from the latest version of the code, particularly when working with multiple contributors across different time zones. Hence, we use GitHub to serve the needs with a specific workflow below. Please see below for an overview of the GitHub workflow.

.. _github-workflow-overview:

What is the general the workflow?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting a new Python package in Level 4 and 5 requires a basic understanding of GitHub's workflow, we will provide you with a brief overview and how to set up your repository.

First, if you are working on a package from an organization like ``github.com/diffpy`` or ``github.com/Billingegroup``, you first copy the repository of the organization to your GitHub user account. This process is called ``forking``.

Then, you will download the forked repository in your GitHub account to your local machine. This process is called ``cloning``.

In the cloned repository on your local machine, you will make edits. You want to first add a description for the changes by "committing" with a message describing the changes. Then you will upload these changes to the ``forked`` repository in your account. This process of updating code from the local computer to the repository hosted by GitHub is called ``pushing``.

From the forked repository, you then want to upload changes to the repository under ``github.com/Billingegroup/scikit-package``, for example. This process is done through a process called ``pull request``. The Project Owner reviews this pull request and merges it into the Billinge group's repository. If you are the contributor as well as the Project Owner, you would be the one who reviews your own code and merges your changes.

I have a general understanding of fork, clone, commit, push, and pull request. How do I set up my repository for packaging?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please be familiar with the terminology such as "fork", "clone", "push", and "pull request" :ref:`above <github-workflow-overview>`.

You may fork the repository using the "Fork" button on the top right corner of the repository page. This will copy the repository to your GitHub account. e.g., ``github.com/Billingegroup/scikit-package`` to ``github.com/sbillinge/scikit-package``.

Then download the forked repository under your account to the local machine by cloning:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/<username>/<package-name>

Now, you also want to link with the repository of the organization by adding the URL. Recall, we want to make changes from the latest state of the source code.

.. code-block:: bash

  git remote add upstream https://github.com/<org-name>/<package-name>

.. note::

   What is ``upstream``? The repository that you forked from, e.g. ``Billingegroup/scikit-package`` is referred to as the ``upstream`` repository.

Verify that you have the ``upstream`` URL set up as the organization.

.. code-block:: bash

  git remote -v

Notice that you also have ``origin`` with an URL linking to your forked repository under your account. This is another GitHub jargon that refers to your forked repository.

.. note::

  What is ``remote``? The term ``remote`` is the opposite of ``local``. In other words, ``remote`` refers to the repository that is hosted by GitHub. e.g., ``github.com/Billingegroup/scikit-package`` or ``github.com/sbillinge``.

Do you have a general summary of each term used in the GitHub workflow?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:fork: The process of copying a repository from an organization to your GitHub account. e.g., ``github.com/Billingegroup/scikit-package`` to ``github.com/sbillinge/scikit-package``.

:upstream: The repository of the original source code. e.g., ``github.com/Billingegroup/scikit-package``.

:origin: The forked repository under your account. e.g., ``github.com/sbillinge/scikit-package``.

:remote: The repository that is hosted by GitHub. e.g., ``github.com/Billingegroup/scikit-package`` or ``github.com/sbillinge/scikit-package``.

:branch: The branch serves as a folder that contains the files of the repository. The ``main`` branch is the branch that is used for the final version of the code. Many branches can be created for different features or bug fixes that are later merged into the ``main`` branch.

:git clone: The process of locally downloading a repository from GitHub (``remote``) to your local machine.

:git push: The process of updating code from the local computer to the GitHub remote repository. Push can be made to the ``origin`` or ``upstream`` repository. But, in our workflow, we push to the ``origin`` repository, and then we create a pull request to merge the changes from ``origin`` to the ``upstream`` repository.

:git commit: The process of adding a description for the changes made in the files that are ready to be pushed.

:git add: The process of selecting files to be included within a single commit.

I have cloned and added ``upstream``. What is the next step?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We want to first sync our local folder with the ``upstream`` repository. This process is called ``pulling``.

.. code-block:: bash

  git checkout main
  git pull upstream main

Above, we checkout the ``main`` branch of your cloned folder. We then download all the latest changes from the ``upstream`` repository. Recall that a GitHub repository is contributed by multiple contributors. Hence, we want to ensure that we are working with the latest version of the code in the ``main`` branch.

Once we are fully synced with the ``upstream`` repository, we can now start making changes to the code.

Instead of directly working in the ``main`` branch of your cloned repository, you will create a copy of ``main`` by "branching" it from ``main``. Think of a tree. You can name it anything you want like ``docs-faq``, etc.

.. code-block:: bash

  git checkout -b docs-faq

The above command not only creates a new branch but also switches to the new branch. You can verify that you are in the new branch by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  git branch

Of course, you can always switch back to the ``main`` branch by using ``git checkout main``.

Now, you are ready to make changes to the code in the branch. If you have a README file in your project, try to modify it. Once you are done, you want to add the changes to a hidden folder called ``.git``. This process is called ``staging``.

.. code-block:: bash

  git add README.rst

Then, now you want to commit the changes with a message describing the changes.

.. code-block:: bash

  git commit -m "docs: added a FAQ section in the README"

Now, you want to push the changes to the ``origin`` repository under your account. Recall ``origin`` refers to the forked repository under your account hosted by GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash

  git push --set-upstream origin docs-FAQ

Go to your forked repository under your account on GitHub. You will see a green button that says "Compare & pull request". Click on it. You will see the changes you made in the branch. Click on "Create pull request". Add a description of the changes you made. Click on "Create pull request".

The reviewer will review the changes and merge them into the ``upstream`` repository. You have successfully made your first contribution to the organization's repository.

I still need to make another pull request. How do I do that?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, you want to make another pull request. You want to make sure that you are working with the latest version of the code in the ``main`` branch.

.. code-block:: bash

  git checkout main
  git pull upstream main

The command above will sync your local folder with the ``upstream`` repository. It should download the changes made by other contributors as well as the recent commit you made in the ``docs-FAQ`` branch, for example.

Again, you checkout a new branch from the ``main`` branch. You can name it anything you want, e.g. ``docs-typo``.

.. code-block:: bash

  git checkout -b docs-typo

You repeat the process of git add, commit, push to your ``origin`` (your forked repository) and then make a PR to the ``upstream`` repository (the organization's repository).

Maintaining ``scikit-package``
