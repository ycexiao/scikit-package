========================
Billinge Group standards
========================

We present here standards of coding and coding workflows that have been adopted in the Billinge research group over multiple years to make our code more uniform and maintainable by a diverse and shifting team of students and post-docs. They are mostly adopting what we have learned to be standards in the Python community, with some lessons learned along the way. This is not the only way to do things, but since it has taken us lots of trial and error to develop them over time, we share them here in case they are useful to you.

GitHub workflow
---------------

Commit messages and issue titles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For commit messages and issue titles, we add prefixes adopted from https://www.conventionalcommits.org:

.. code-block:: text

    feat: A new feature has been added.
    fix: A bug has been fixed.
    docs: Documentation changes only.
    style: Changes that don't affect code functionality (e.g., formatting, whitespace).
    refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
    perf: Performance improvements.
    test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing ones.
    chore: Updates to the build process or auxiliary tools.
    build: Changes that affect the build artifact or external dependencies.
    ci: Updates to CI configuration files and scripts.
    revert: Reverts a previous commit.
    release: A new package version is being prepared.
    skpkg: Using scikit-package to create a new package or maintain an existing package.

- Example 1: "feat: create a ``DiffractionObject.morph_to()`` method"
- Example 2: "bug: handle divide by zero error in ``DiffractionObject.scale_to``"

Please see an example here: https://github.com/scikit-package/scikit-package/issues. There are a few benefits to adding prefixes to GitHub issue titles. First, it helps us prioritize tasks from the GitHub notifications. Second, it helps reference issues in a comment within an issue or pull request and organize tasks.

    How do I write a good Git commit message?

    A commit message is written for PR reviewers and for debuggers. Avoid verbosity for a quick overview. An ideal commit message communicates file(s) of interest, the reason for the modification, and what modifications were made. e.g., “chore: move all files from docs to doc for scikit-packaging."

.. attention::

    How do I write a good GitHub issue title?

    The issue is where we discuss and determine whether to implement via a pull request. It's much easier for the project maintainer(s) to recall the problem/intended behavior and the technique in that order. Here are some examples:

        e.g., "feat: set custom default prompt values after ``package create <command>`` using hidden config file."

        e.g., "feat: preview rendered documentation in each PR with GitHub Actions"

    If you have a **suggestion**, you can also create an issue with a question mark:

        e.g., "refactor: how can we dynamically retrieve python min/max default Python versions in documentation?"

        e.g., "refactor: can we standarlize the way we write CHANGELOG (news.rst file)?"

Pull request practices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Have a theme for each PR to reduce cognitive overload for the reviewer.

#. Make PRs small with the possibility of rejection.

#. Write ``closes #<issue-number>`` in the PR comment to automatically close the issue when the PR is merged. See https://github.com/scikit-package/scikit-package/pull/350.

#. A PR should **close an issue** on GitHub. If there is no issue, make one. If the issue is big, consider breaking it down into smaller issues.

#. **Review** your own PR. Start as a draft PR, click :guilabel:`Files changed`, add comments, and then request a review. In-line comments are needed if the changes are not obvious for the reviewer. See https://github.com/scikit-package/scikit-package/pull/310.

#. If **another commit** was pushed after *“@username ready for review”*, write another comment *“@username ready for review after fixing ____”* so that the reviewer is directed to the PR, not the file changes by the new commit.

#. Use the pull request template provided in ``.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE``. In the PR comment, **highlight inputs and outputs** of the changes (screenshots/outputs).

#. **Address all** in-line comments made by the reviewer(s) before asking for another round of review. If you have seen a comment and agree with it but no action is needed, a thumbs-up emoji is sufficient.

#. Use ``>`` to quote the reviewer's sentence(s) and write your response below it. If there are multiple comments, tag the reviewer(s) with @username.

#. During PR review, when reviewers propose new ideas or suggestions beyond the scope of the PR, create an issue using the issue template and include a link to the specific PR comment URL (not the PR itself). Then, reply to the reviewer(s) to confirm that the issue has been created.

#. PR from a new branch if it contains a meaningless commit history.

#. Do not force push. Use ``git revert`` to unwind the previous commit.

#. If you've made a mistake but have not used ``git add``, use ``git restore <file-name>``.

#. Before CI is integrated, include local test passing results in each PR to save time for the reviewer.

#. For migrating files from one folder to another folder, use ``git mv``.

#. For deleting files generated by the OS such as ``.DS_Store`` use ``git rm`` instead of ``git add`` to also remove from the Git index (staging area).

#. When a PR is closed for any reason, add a single sentence in the comment explaining why the PR is being closed. If a new PR is created, add the new PR link in the comment.

.. _news-item-practice:

Writing news items for release notes
------------------------------------

.. include:: ../snippets/news-file-format.rst

Writing tutorials
-----------------

#. In general, we want to provide step-by-step instructions, including CLI commands and expected outputs. However, to avoid "reinventing the internet", we should provide recommended workflows and tools. For example, in ``scikit-package``, we recommend using ``Git for Windows`` for Windows users so that everyone, including macOS and Linux users, can also follow the same steps.

Unit tests
----------

Why do we write unit tests?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We write tests to document the intended behavior of the code. When refactoring tests, consider what we “want” to happen, rather writing tweaking the existing test functions to pass.

Group and organize test cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following practices have been developed to ensure consistency in writing tests:

#. Comment starts with a uppercase letter (PEP8 standard) unless it's a name starting with a lowercase letter like a function name.

#. Include a high-level test function comment e.g., ``# Test conversion of q to tth with q and wavelength``

#. Use ``C1: Start with a capital letter...`` or ``Case 1: Start...`` for each condition under ``@pytest.mark.parametrize``.

#. If applicable, group similar test conditions under a single case. Numerate each test condition.

#. Divide a test case comment into two parts: ``x, y, z (conditions), expect...``. Ensure there is a ``expect`` keyword after the test conditions provided.

#. Use descriptive yet concise variable names for expected values (e.g., ``expected_xarrays`` instead of ``expected``)

#. Order test cases from the most general to edge cases. This helps readers understand the basic function behavior first before utilizing or encountering unusual features or behaviors.

#. Consider moving reusable code objects to ``conftest.py``. See warning messages and objects defined in https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.utils/blob/main/tests/conftest.py available in each test function in https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.utils/blob/main/tests/test_diffraction_objects.py/

Pytest example 1

.. code-block:: python

  @pytest.mark.parametrize(
      "xtype, expected_xarray",
      [
          # Test whether on_xtype returns the correct xarray values
          # C1: tth to tth, expect no change in xarray value
          # 1. "tth" provided, expect tth
          # 2. "2theta" provided, expect tth
          ("tth", np.array([30, 60])),
          ("2theta", np.array([30, 60])),
          # C2: "q" provided, expect q converted from tth
          ("q", np.array([0.51764, 1])),
          # C3: "d" provided, expect d converted from tth
          ("d", np.array([12.13818, 6.28319])),
      ],
  )
  def test_on_xtype(xtype, expected_xarray, do_minimal_tth):
      pass

- Add `# C1:` inside within `( ... )`. More examples `here <https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.utils/pull/277>`_.

Comment starts with a uppercase letter (PEP8 standard) unless it's a name starting with a lowercase letter like a function name.

Docstrings
----------

Please bookmark the following:

    PEP257: https://peps.python.org/pep-0257

    PEP8: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

    NumPy document style guide: https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html

In the group, we follow the NumPy standard:

#. A one-line summary that does not use variable names or the function name is added before a full description.

#. Use "Return a dict" instead of "Returns a dict". Comments are instructions.

#. "The" is used for the starting description of attribute/parameter/return.

#. Full docstrings are not required for private functions.

For examples, please refer to https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.utils/blob/main/src/diffpy/utils/diffraction_objects.py.

.. _file-folder-naming-convention:

Naming conventions
------------------

When should we use hyphens ``-`` or underscores ``_`` in file and folder names?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use hyphens ``-`` for project names, package names, GitHub repositories, folder names, branch names, and static files like ``.rst``, ``.md``, ``.yml``, and ``.png``. For CLI, also use hyphens ``-`` for args like ``gh pr list --author "@sbillinge"`` Check an example documentation of ``scikit-package`` here: https://github.com/scikit-package/scikit-package/tree/main/docs/source.

Use underscores ``_`` in the following two cases:

#. Python files, e.g., ``tests/test_diffraction_objects.py``.

#. Project directory names, e.g., ``src/<project_directory_name>``. Modules and packages are imported with spaces replaced by underscores, like ``import bg_mpl_stylesheets``. Here is an example project: https://github.com/scikit-package/bg-mpl-stylesheets/tree/main/src/bg_mpl_stylesheets.

.. note::

  ``scikit-package`` automatically creates a folder with underscores ``_`` for the project directory name and ``.py`` files. We recommend using a single word for folder names that contain Python scripts, e.g., ``src/example_package/parsers``, so that it can be imported as ``from example_package.parsers import <module>``. This follows Python conventions.

.. warning::

    There are still cases where we do not strictly follow the above conventions, typically for configuration files. In such cases, we adhere to the naming conventions of the respective tool. For example, ``.codespell/ignore_lines.txt`` is a configuration file for the ``codespell`` tool. ``.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`` is the designated folder for storing GitHub issue templates. If you are unsure, please feel free to open an issue in the ``scikit-package`` GitHub repository.

Error message
-------------

Divide an error message into two sections: (1) reason for error, (2) what to do to fix it. Ex) "Both release and pre-release specified. Please re-run the command specifying either release or pre_release.” Error messages are for users. Consider users without programming knowledge.

Deprecating functions
---------------------

As codebases evolve, function and method names are sometimes updated to
follow improved naming conventions. When this happens, we want to warn
users that the old name will be removed in a future release while keeping
their existing code working in the meantime. This process is called
**deprecation**.

This guide describes the **simplest and most common case**:
renaming a function **in place**, without changing its location or API.

Example:

* Old name: ``diffpy.package.MyClass.myFunction``
* New name: ``diffpy.package.MyClass.my_function``


Import the deprecation utilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Python versions ``< 3.13``, we use DiffPy’s internal deprecation
decorator. (The syntax matches Python’s built-in decorator in newer
versions.)

Add the following import near the top of the module,

::

   from diffpy.utils._deprecator import deprecated, build_deprecation_message


Define the deprecation message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Define a single deprecation message near the top of the file. This message
should clearly state,

- what is deprecated
- when it will be removed
- what to use instead

For this example,

::

   base = "diffpy.package.MyClass"
   removal_version = "4.0.0"

   myFunction_deprecation_msg = build_deprecation_message(
       base,
       "myFunction",
       "my_function",
       removal_version,
   )

Because the function is not moving, ``new_base`` is omitted.


Add the new function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create the new function with its updated name. This should be the
*canonical implementation* going forward.

::

   class MyClass:

       def my_function(self, x):
           """Perform an important calculation."""
           return x * 2


Mark the old function as deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Keep the old function name, but,

1. Decorate it with ``@deprecated``
2. Replace its body with a call to the new function
3. Update its docstring to clearly state the deprecation

To generate a consistent deprecation docstring, use the helper command,

::

   package add deprecation my_function 4.0.0 -n diffpy.package.MyClass

This command prints a ready-to-use docstring indicating the removal
version and the replacement function. Copy and paste the output into the
deprecated function.

The deprecated method should then look like this,

::

   class MyClass:

       def my_function(self, x):
           """Perform an important calculation."""
           return x * 2

       @deprecated(myFunction_deprecation_msg)
       def myFunction(self, x):
           """This function has been deprecated and will be removed in
           version 4.0.0.

           Please use diffpy.package.MyClass.my_function instead.
           """
           return self.my_function(x)

Duplicate tests for the new function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, ensure that both the deprecated function and the new function are
covered by tests.

Locate the existing tests that exercise the old function name
``myFunction``. Copy these tests and update them to call the new function
name ``my_function`` instead. This ensures that:

- The new function behaves identically to the old one
- Refactoring does not accidentally change behavior
- Both code paths are validated during the deprecation period

Ideally, when you run tests in the following steps, only one
deprecation warning should be emitted per function that has been deprecated.
This is to keep the deprecation task organize.

For example, if the original test looks like this,

::

   def test_myFunction():
       obj = MyClass()
       assert obj.myFunction(2) == 4

Duplicate it for the new function:

::

   def test_my_function():
       obj = MyClass()
       assert obj.my_function(2) == 4

At this stage, **both tests should pass** and exercise the same underlying
logic.

Do not remove the tests for the deprecated function until the removal
release. These tests act as a safeguard to ensure the deprecated wrapper
continues to work as expected.


Update internal usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that both the new and deprecated function names exist, update the
codebase to use the **new function name everywhere internally**.

Do a global search for the old name ``myFunction`` and replace it with
``my_function`` in all source files *except* for,

- The deprecated wrapper function itself
- Test cases that explicitly test the deprecated behavior
- API documentation where the function is intentionally marked as
  ``@deprecated``

The goal is to ensure that,

- All internal code paths exercise the new implementation
- The deprecated function exists only as a thin compatibility layer
  for external users
- No new internal code is added that depends on the deprecated name

After this step, the only remaining references to ``myFunction`` should
be the deprecated method definition and its associated tests.

This ensures that removing the deprecated function in the future will
not require any additional internal refactoring.


Verify the deprecation warning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the package locally and run the test suite,

::

   pip install .
   pip install pytest
   pytest

If done correctly, pytest should pass and emit a warning when using ``myFunction``.
The message should look something like,

::

   'diffpy.package.MyClass.myFunction' is deprecated and will be removed
   in version 4.0.0. Please use 'diffpy.package.MyClass.my_function' instead.

Check the documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To check if the documentation is updated with the deprecation message,
build the documentation locally and open the index page,

::
    make html docs/ && open docs/build/html/index.html

Note, this command might vary depending on your project’s documentation setup.

Removal
^^^^^^^

In the removal release (e.g. ``4.0.0``),

- Delete ``myFunction``
- Remove the deprecation message
- Remove the tests for ``myFunction``
- Keep ``my_function`` as the sole implementation

Congrats, you have successfully deprecated a function!

Other considerations for maintaining group infrastructure
---------------------------------------------------------

#. Be extremely careful with changes that are visible to users.

#. Try not to pass down technical debt to future members. Do the extra work so that others can save time. Ex) making a PR to the ``scikit-package`` repo once an issue has been identified in a project standardlized with ``scikit-package``.

#. Design code to save developer time in the long run rather than focusing solely on reducing compute time, especially when computing resources are not the primary constraint.

#. It is easier to remove things (e.g., dependencies) we don't want than to add things that are needed in certain circumstances.
